I upload my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) here. Some
are completed retroactively. Sometimes I focus on being fast; at other times, I
try to learn another language.

I wait to push a day's commit until there is little chance of interfering with
any leaderboard. This usually is the day after.
